# **PYTHON CLI APPLICATION**

## **PROJECT NAME : JOB_HOUSE**

######**GETTING STARTED**

**Installing Dependencies**

    python 3.7
    
 follow Instructions to install the lastest version of python
 for your platform in the (https://docs.python.org/3/)

**Virtual Environment**

I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using
python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project
separate and organised. Instructions for settings up a virtual
environment for your platform can be found in the (https://docs.python.org/3/)

**Pip Dependencies**

Once you have your virtual environments setup and running you are good to go.

**A key dependencies.**

Sqlite3 : is a light weight database system used in storing data 
that is sent from the users.Luckily it is already a module in the python framework and you not needed 
to install it separately. 
 
**ABOUT JOB_HOUSE**

Some few things you might need to know before using the CLI_Application

At entry level running the app for the first time you will be required to
register as a new user and after registration you will be redirected to the login part where you will provide your **username and password**
 and a key note is that providing wrong username and password would not grant you access so dont bother trying.
